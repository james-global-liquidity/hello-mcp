# Understanding MCP (Multi-Context Processing) Servers

## What is MCP?

Multi-Context Processing (MCP) is an architecture that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with external systems and tools. This allows Claude to perform actions beyond conversation, such as accessing external data sources, manipulating files, or interacting with APIs.

## Key Features of MCP Servers

- **Tool Integration**: MCP servers allow AI models to use specialized tools to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be outside their capabilities.
- **Stateful Operations**: MCP maintains context across multiple interactions, allowing for complex, multi-step workflows.
- **API Interactions**: MCP enables Claude to make API calls to external services, like GitHub, expanding its functionality.
- **Security Boundaries**: MCP provides a secure way for AI systems to interact with external systems while maintaining appropriate access controls.

## Benefits of MCP

- Extends AI capabilities beyond text generation
- Enables practical applications like file management, code execution, and data manipulation
- Provides a structured framework for AI-tool interaction
- Allows for complex workflows that combine multiple tools

## Use Cases

- Software development assistance (GitHub operations, code generation)
- Data analysis and visualization
- Document creation and management
- Complex, multi-step task automation

MCP represents an important evolution in AI assistant technology, bridging the gap between conversational AI and practical tool use.
